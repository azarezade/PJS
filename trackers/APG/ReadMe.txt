This code includes the detailed implementation of our work [1], which is the extention of [2] and [3]. Also, it can be easily adapted to demonstrate the L1 tackers [2] and [3].

Instruction to run the demo code:
1. First, you should run "Installmex" to compile the "IMGaffine_c.c" file to generate the mex file for your matlab platform. If "IMGaffine_c.c" cannot be compiled on your platform, you can replace the function "IMGaffine_c"  in "crop_candidates" and "corner2image" by "IMGaffine_r".
2. "demo_Car4.m" is a demo for tracking. 
3. The main tracking algorithm is contained in "L1TrackingBPR_APGup.m".
